Web Software of 20+ years. Worked with giants such as Meta, Apple, Nokia, Lloyds, Bumble, Delivery Hero etc. I created [zyneai](https://zyne.digital) (previously zynedigital), and run [webdeepdive.org](https://webdeepdive.org). I am a fan of Devcontainers and you can see the features I contributed to [here](https://containers.dev/features?search=siri404) and can use the features published as packages [here](https://github.com/siri404?tab=packages).
